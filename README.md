# 🍏 Contacts iOS

The Contacts application, implemented in native iOS.

## ⚒️ Get Started

We are using [Tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist) to manage the project configuration for better maintenance, instead of relying only on the Xcode generated files.

Make sure you have [mise-en-place](https://github.com/jdx/mise) installed on your machine before proceeding.

In order to configure the project, after cloning the repository, on the root directory of the cloned source code type `mise install` to install the required dependencies for the project.

After that, with Tuist now available, type `tuist generate`. It will generate the necessary Xcode project files and also open the current project on Xcode.

Congrats! You are now ready to contribute to the **Contacts iOS** project 🥳
